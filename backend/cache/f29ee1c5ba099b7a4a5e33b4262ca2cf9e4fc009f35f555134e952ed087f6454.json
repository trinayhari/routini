{"text": "Here are the steps to tie your shoes:\n\n1. Hold the shoelaces in each hand, with the ends facing you.\n\n2. Cross the lace from your right hand over the lace from your left hand to make an \"X\" shape.\n\n3. Take the lace that is now on top and loop it under and through the \"X\" shape.\n\n4. Pull both ends of the laces to tighten the knot.\n\n5. Take the lace that is now on the right side and make a loop or \"bunny ear\" with it.\n\n6. Take the lace from the left side and wrap it around the bunny ear, then push the end through the loop you created.\n\n7. Pull both ends to tighten the bow.\n\nThe key steps are crossing the laces to make an X, looping one lace under and through the X, and then creating the bow with the bunny ears. With a little practice, you'll be able to tie your shoes quickly and easily.
